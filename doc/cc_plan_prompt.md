I want to build a AI conference and event finder. Users enter:
1. Their city
2. Their AI interests and research specialities
3. A time range to search 
4. How far they'll travel (miles)
5. Any other preferences

The app searches for AI conferences and events nearby within a specified time range and return the top 20 recommendations (10 top conferences then 10 top events) with bold titles, dates, location, website URL, a concise description, etc. What are 3 solutions starting with the simplest first? Include a solution that uses the Claude Messages API.
